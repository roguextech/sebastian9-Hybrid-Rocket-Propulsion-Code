main.m

Purpose: Initializes the rocket, the motor and the environement; declares the end time "tend" and launches the ascent calculation.
Functions called: init_rocket(), motor_init( rocket ), environement( Elevation(m), Temperature(C), Pressure(Pa), rocket ), accent_calc(DTF,tend)

init_rocket.m

Purpose: Creates rocket properties array from file for class constructor.
Functions called: none
Methods called: none
Called by: main

rocket.m

Purpose: Creates rocket the rocket class. Defines all the properties of the rocket. The dynamics are continuously updated, any varibales need for functions should come from this class
Functions called: Cd_mandell(obj), Cn_alphaXcp(obj)
Methods defined: constructor, Cd(obj), CnXcp(obj), T(obj), Re(obj), Mass(obj), Xcm(obj), Ibody(obj)
Called by: main

motor_init.m

Purpose: Reads the .eng thrust file of the motors and calculates the reletive properties of the motor. 
Functions called: none
Methods called: none
Called by: main

environement.m

Purpose: Defines the environement class containing all environement variables necessary for the ascent calculation.
Functions called: none
Methods defined: Constructor, g(obj), Temp(obj), mu(obj), Pressure(obj), rho(obj), C(obj), W(obj)
Called by: main

Cn_alphaXcp.m

Purpose: Untidy implementation of the Barrowman Equations. Calculates Cn, Xcp, Cda (coefficient of damping), zeta (damping ratio), Ssm (static stability margin). Ultimately used in accent_calc through the rocket class.

Cd_mandell

Purpose: Untidy implementation of the Mandell Equations. Calculates total drag coefficient.
Functions called: none (?)
