main.m

Purpose: Initializes the rocket, the motor and the environement; declares the end time "tend" and launches the ascent calculation.
Functions called: init_rocket(), motor_init( rocket ), environement( Elevation(m), Temperature(C), Pressure(Pa), rocket ), accent_calc(DTF,tend), extract_data(state, t)
Called by: user

init_rocket.m

Purpose: Creates rocket properties array from file for class constructor.
Functions called: none
Called by: main

rocket.m

Purpose: Creates rocket the rocket class. Defines all the properties of the rocket. The dynamics are continuously updated, any varibales need for functions should come from this class
Functions called: Cd_mandell(obj), Cn_alphaXcp(obj)
Methods defined: constructor, Cd(obj), CnXcp(obj), T(obj), Re(obj), Mass(obj), Xcm(obj), Ibody(obj)
Called by: main

motor_init.m

Purpose: Reads the .eng thrust file of the motors and calculates the reletive properties of the motor. 
Functions called: none
Called by: main

environement.m

Purpose: Defines the environement class containing all environement variables necessary for the ascent calculation.
Functions called: none
Methods defined: Constructor, g(obj), Temp(obj), mu(obj), Pressure(obj), rho(obj), C(obj), W(obj)
Called by: main

Cn_alphaXcp.m

Purpose: Untidy implementation of the Barrowman Equations according to Open Rocket. Calculates Cn, Xcp, Cda (coefficient of damping), zeta (damping ratio), Ssm (static stability margin). Ultimately used in accent_calc through the rocket class.
Functions called: Xcp_Barrowman_f(rocket)
Called by: rocket

Cd_mandell.m

Purpose: Untidy implementation of the Mandell Equations. Calculates total drag coefficient.
Functions called: none (?)
Called by: rocket

extract_data.m

Purpose: Extremely inefficient data logging, not necessary for each calculation.
Functions called: logData(alpha, Cd, Cda, Xcm, Mass, Vmag, Xcp, zeta, Ssm, Ssm_B, Ccm, t)
Called by: main

logData.m

Purpose: Single lined function used only once for adding extracted data to log global variable.
Functions called: none
Called by: extract_data

normalize.m

Purpose: Normalize a Vector.
Functions called: none
Called by: accent_calc

accent_calc.m

Purpose: Solve the differential equations for the trajectory of the rocket.
Functions called: normalize(vector), 
Called by: main.m
