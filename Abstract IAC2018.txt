Hybrid motor sounding rocket design and optimization using theoretical performance model.

The purpose of this work is to develop a complete theoretical model for the hybrid motor sounding rocket performance, to validate the performance results with the ones reported in the literature, and use the model in the development of an application for a, requirement driven, hybrid sounding rocket design and optimization. The first part of the work dives into the model development, which consists on a coupling of the distinct dimensions that affect the hybrid sounding rocket performance: the oxidizer blowdown process, capable of simulating self-pressurization; the combustion chamber thermodynamics, using NASA-CEA for the chemical equilibrium, along with fuel grain regression and chamber pressure models taken from literature; the non-steady one-dimensional nozzle flow; the aerodynamic properties of the rocket, derived from empirical formulas and numerical analysis; and the flight dynamics, with a 6-DOF model; uncertainties are as well characterized using the Monte Carlo method. The second part of the work shows the results of the optimization routine, which minimizes the error of the simulated altitude and the target altitude, as well as the total deviations resulting from the Monte Carlo analysis. A conceptual design is presented for two single stage sounding rockets, for 3 km and 9 km respectively.
