Objective: Design & Predict motor performance under different operating specifications and conditions.

The program uses the performance module to iteratively create a design.

The program evaluates the state of the system unidimensionally through 3 control volumes:
    CV1: Discharging process of the oxydizer tank, driven by the pressure difference 
        between the oxidyzer tank and the combustion chamber.
        System of 3 first-order ODEs.
    CV2: Modeling of the combustion, driven from the regression rate of the fuel grain,
        and the change in propellant's termochemestry
    CV3: Mass flow rate of the combustion products, nozzle.
